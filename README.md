### - ⚡ Fun fact: ...I m a Mechanical Engineer But have keen interest in Data Fields, I realized that while machines may have a lot of gears, data engineering allows me to work with even more data points! So, I figured, why not switch from tinkering with physical gears to wrangling digital ones? It's a whole new world of gears, just with a lot less grease!
